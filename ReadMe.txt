Issues:
1. Coupling between Producers and Consumers.
2. Would have preferred to 'generify' the Producers and Consumers, passing any type of object.
3. I wasn't able to allow Consumers to register their interest in an object. I consider the Observer pattern but decided against it.
4. I used a Linked List as opposed to an array because it's faster for allowing deletion from positions other than head/tail.
5.
